# Portfolio

An older version of my Web Developer portfolio.
At one point, I had all of my projects hosted on my portfolioi instead of Github Pages.
I used Node.js and Express.js and hosted on heroku.
Also implemented SASS, Handlebars, and Gulp to quickly deploy changes to all projects and minify them.
I eventually converted this to a static site without the projects attached so their code could be more easily viewed and copied.
