He went on to get his master's in theology and later he began to practice several schools of thought including: Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, Pantheism, Christianity, Religious Naturalism, and Taoism.</p></section><section class="row"> <img class="image col-md-6" src="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alan-watts-graphic.jpg"><p class="col-md-6">Alan Watts' experimention with psychedelics suchs as mescaline, LSD, and marijuana led him to conclude: <em><q>If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.</q></em></p></section><section class="row"> <img class="image col-md-6" src="http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/17004250/alan-watts-death-art.png"><p class="col-md-6">One concept he discusses in his book is a <em>koan</em>. Koans are riddles used to demonstrate the limitations of rational thought. Consider this koan: <em><q>What is your original face before you were born?</q></em> Spoiler: there is no rational answer to this question, so the only possible response to a koan is another koan. In other words, spontaneity.</p></section><p>One of his most notable works, <em><q>The Way of Zen</q></em>, offered one of the best Western interpretations of Zen Buddhism. <em><q>[F]or Zen there is no duality, no conflict between the natural element of chance and the human element of control. The constructive powers of the human mind are no more artificial than the formative actions of plants or bees, so that from the standpoint of Zen it is no contradiction to say that artistic technique is discipline in spontaneity and spontaneity in discipline.</q></em></p><div class="row booksRow"><section class="col-md-4"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Way-Zen-Alan-W-Watts/dp/0375705104/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1506210165&sr=8-4&keywords=alan+watts"><img class="books" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HA0bawfaL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Book"></a></br><a class="amazon btn btn-info btn-xs" href="https://www.amazon.com/Way-Zen-Alan-W-Watts/dp/0375705104/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1506210165&sr=8-4&keywords=alan+watts" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-shopping-basket" aria-hidden="true"></i><p2>Amazon</p2></a></section><section class="col-md-4"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Age-Anxiety/dp/0307741206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506210165&sr=8-1&keywords=alan+watts"><img class="books" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EVI33c4pL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Book"></a></br><a class="amazon btn btn-info btn-xs" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Age-Anxiety/dp/0307741206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506210165&sr=8-1&keywords=alan+watts" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-shopping-basket" aria-hidden="true"></i><p2>Amazon</p2></a></section><section class="col-md-4"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Taboo-Against-Knowing-Who/dp/0679723005/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1506210165&sr=8-3&keywords=alan+watts"><img class="books" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QdCr7TMJL.jpg" alt="Book"></a></br><a class="amazon btn btn-info btn-xs" href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Taboo-Against-Knowing-Who/dp/0679723005/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1506210165&sr=8-3&keywords=alan+watts" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-shopping-basket" aria-hidden="true"></i><p2>Amazon</p2></a></section></div></div></body> {{> footer}}
